## Session Exercises: Exploring the Data

#### 1. The "Data Gap" Detective
* **Goal:** Identify spatial bias in biodiversity recording.
* **Task:** Zoom into the **Simien Mountains** or **Bale Mountains National Park** on the GBIF map.
* **Exercise:** Compare the density of records inside the park boundaries versus the areas immediately outside.
* **Discovery:** Does the map reflect where the animals actually live, or simply where the roads, tourists, and researchers go?

#### 2. The "Deep Time" Timeline
* **Goal:** Explore temporal data and historical records.
* **Task:** Search for the **African Elephant** (*Loxodonta africana*) in East Africa.
* **Exercise:** Use the **Year** filter to compare records from **1900–1950** against **2010–2025**.
* **Discovery:** Look at the **"Basis of Record."** Notice how historical data is dominated by "Preserved Specimens" (museums), while modern data is dominated by "Human Observations" (citizen science).

#### 3. The "Taxonomic Backbone" Challenge
* **Goal:** Understand how GBIF handles synonyms and local names.
* **Task:** Search for the **Teff** plant using its local name vs. its scientific name (*Eragrostis tef*).
* **Exercise:** Explore the **Taxonomy** tab on the species page.
* **Discovery:** See how GBIF groups various scientific synonyms under one **"Accepted Name."** This ensures you don't miss data just because a researcher used an older or alternative name.

#### 4. The "Media Explorer"
* **Goal:** Use GBIF for visual verification.
* **Task:** Filter for **Orchids** (*Orchidaceae*) in Ethiopia.
* **Exercise:** Apply the filter **"Has Image"** and browse the gallery.
* **Task:** Pick one image and trace it back to its **Dataset** (e.g., "iNaturalist research-grade observations" or "The Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute").

## Cheat Sheet: Interpreting GBIF Data

### 1. The "Big Three" Metrics
* **Occurrences:** The total number of individual records.
* **Datasets:** The number of different studies or collections contributing data.
* **Publishing Institutions:** The organizations (Museums, NGOs, Universities) sharing the data.

### 2. Common Data "Flags" to Watch For
* **Coordinates Rounded:** Indicates the location might not be precise.
* **Individual Count Missing:** We know the species was there, but not how many.
* **Taxon Match Fuzzy:** The name in the original data didn't perfectly match the master list.

### 3. Understanding "Basis of Record"
* **Living Specimen:** Often from botanical gardens—great for ID, but not a "wild" location.
* **Fossil Specimen:** Important for historical range, but don't include it in modern conservation models!
* **Literature:** Data extracted from old journals or books.

### 4. Navigating the Species Page
* **Metrics Tab:** Best for seeing charts of when the species is most active (Seasonality).
* **Map Tab:** Best for identifying "Outliers" (e.g., a mountain bird recorded in the middle of the ocean).

## Cheat Sheet: The Ethiopia Country Dashboard

### 1. Key Metrics to Watch
* **Occurrences about Ethiopia:** All data points located within the country boundaries, regardless of who published them.
* **Occurrences from Ethiopia:** Data published by Ethiopian institutions (showing national research output).
* **Species Count:** The number of unique scientific names recorded in the country.

### 2. Identifying Data Gaps
* **Spatial Gaps:** Check the map for "empty" regions. Are they truly empty, or just under-sampled?
* **Taxonomic Gaps:** Look for groups like "Insects" or "Flowering Plants." Often, these have far fewer records than Birds, representing a "knowledge gap."

### 3. Usage Statistics
* **Download Activity:** See how many researchers globally are downloading data from Ethiopia. This shows the global importance of the Rift Valley’s biodiversity.
* **Research Links:** Every publication listed on this page is linked to the specific datasets it used via DOIs.

> ## Excercise:
> 
> 1. How many data publishers are active in Ethiopia?
> 2. How many datasets do contain records about Ethiopia?
> 3. How many datasets are published by Ethiopia?
> 4. Navigate to the INBO (Research Institute for Nature and Forest) IPT and check how many publishers are making use of this IPT instance
> 5. Navigate to [www.biodiversity.be](www.biodioversity.be) and find GBIF info
