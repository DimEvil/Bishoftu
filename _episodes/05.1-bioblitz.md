# Understanding occurrence data
By Lena Thöle


With over 2 billion records, GBIF is the world’s largest window into biological diversity. But how do you go from a massive cloud of data points to a robust, publication-ready analysis?

We move beyond simple downloads to explore the "fitness-for-use" of biodiversity data. You’ll learn to navigate the Darwin Core standard, utilize programmatic tools like rgbif, and apply rigorous data-cleaning protocols to handle taxonomic uncertainty and spatial bias. Whether you are modeling species distributions or tracking invasive species, this session will give you the toolkit to use global data with local precision.

# Bioblitz
By Dimitri Brosens

## From Field to Files: The Bishoftu Bioblitz on iNaturalist

Get ready to turn your curiosity into high-quality scientific data as we explore the rich biodiversity of Bishoftu’s crater lakes. During this Bioblitz, we will use iNaturalist to document every plant, bird, and insect we encounter, transforming our sightings into digital "occurrence records" in real-time. This session isn't just about exploring the Rift Valley; it’s your hands-on introduction to the GBIF data pipeline. You’ll learn how a single snapshot on your phone becomes a verified data point used by researchers worldwide, setting the stage for the technical data-cleaning and analysis work we’ll tackle in the rest of this workshop.

> ## Action : Bishoftu Bioblitz
> 
> The [INaturalist website](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is the place where you will start your Bioblitz
> 1. Go to inaturalist.org and register
> 2. Go to the tab project and search for cesp ethiopia
> 3. Click on Croment Bioblitz and join
> 4. Check [this](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/video+tutorials) tutorial video
> 5. How many observations from Ethiopia are already in INaturalist?
> 6. And how many of them are on GBIF?
>    
> > ## TASK
> > 1. Go out in nature
> > 2. Add observations to INaturalist
> > 3. Check the competition
> >
> > ## SOLUTION
> > 5. Check [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=46.5550204&nelng=19.4473767&place_id=any&subview=map&swlat=42.3385087&swlng=13.3649)
> > 6. Check [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?country=HR&publishing_org=28eb1a3f-1c15-4a95-931a-4af90ecb574d&occurrence_status=present)
