# Hands-on: Downloading via GBIF.org, wrap-up and discussions
By Lena and Dimitri

In this session, we transition from the field to the digital laboratory. Participants will learn how to navigate the **GBIF.org** portal to locate, filter, and download the data that underpins global conservation efforts.

To make the learning process engaging, we have designed a series of exercises centered on the unique ecosystems of **Ethiopia** and the wider **African continent**.

---

### **Session Exercises: Hands-on with GBIF**

#### **1. The "Endemic Hunter" Challenge**

* **Goal:** Learn basic taxonomic and geographic filtering.
* **Task:** Search for the **Ethiopian Wolf** (*Canis simensis*) or the **Gelada Monkey** (*Theropithecus gelada*).
* **Exercise:** Filter the results to include only observations from **Ethiopia** that have **coordinates** and **images**.
* **Bonus:** Compare the "Observation" records (citizen science) vs. "Preserved Specimen" records (museums) for these species. Which dataset is larger?

#### **2. Mapping the "Bishoftu Blueprint"**

* **Goal:** Use the "Search by Polygon" tool for localized data.
* **Task:** Using the map interface on GBIF.org, draw a custom polygon around the **Bishoftu Crater Lakes** area.
* **Exercise:** Download a **Species List** (CSV) of all organisms recorded within that specific shape.
* **Discussion:** How many of these records originated from the iNaturalist Bioblitz we just conducted?

#### **3. The "Invasive Alert" (Regional Focus)**

* **Goal:** Understand temporal trends and data flags.
* **Task:** Search for the **Parthenium weed** (*Parthenium hysterophorus*), a major invasive species in East Africa.
* **Exercise:** Use the **Year** slider to see how the number of records in Africa has grown over the last 20 years.
* **Quality Check:** Identify how many records are "flagged" for geospatial issues (e.g., coordinates that fall in the ocean instead of on land).

#### **4. The "Great Download"**

* **Goal:** Master download formats and citations.
* **Task:** Perform a "Simple" download for all **Avian (Bird)** records in Ethiopia from the last 5 years.
* **Exercise:** Once the download is ready, locate the **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**.
* **Importance:** We will practice citing this DOI—this is the most critical step for ensuring data providers get credit for their work!

## GBIF Search Filter Cheat Sheet

### 1. Basis of Record
* **Human Observation:** Citizen science and field sightings (e.g., iNaturalist).
* **Preserved Specimen:** Physical samples from museums or herbaria.
* **Living Specimen:** Botanical gardens or zoos.
* **Machine Observation:** Camera traps or sensors.

### 2. Location & Coordinates
* **Has Coordinate:** Always check this if you plan to map the data.
* **Has Geospatial Issue:** If checked, it shows records where coordinates might be wrong (e.g., in the ocean). *Usually best to exclude these.*

### 3. Data Quality
* **Occurrence Status:** Choose **Present** to see where things were found.
* **Identification Qualifier:** Look for "Confirmed" or "Research Grade" for higher reliability.

### 4. Licenses (Usage Rights)
* **CC0 / CC-BY:** Open data. Most scientific use requires **CC-BY** (you must cite the DOI).

### 5. Taxonomic Backbone
* **Scientific Name:** Use the Latin name for accuracy.
* **Taxon Key:** A unique ID GBIF uses to track species regardless of name changes.

# GBIF Discussion (optional)

What challenges are next in relation to:

1. **Data Quality**: Discuss the challenges and strategies for ensuring the quality of biodiversity data in GBIF. How can we address issues such as incomplete or inaccurate data?

Quality is important, and data should be verified (AI could help in some parts, but in the end you need well trained AI. Specialists are still very needed. Especially for difficult species. Imprtant shoul be the versioning of the verification of data . Spatial visualisation is important, and in the contract shoud be notad that data publication (quality data should be published)
  
2. **Data Access and Use**: Explore the various ways researchers, policymakers, and the public can access and utilize the data available through GBIF. How can we maximize the impact of this data for conservation and research?

Maximizing the use of data. There is the need to improve the data coverage (geographically and also by environmental conditions.) Gap analysis.... Environmental variables. Support and collaborate with the for example Biodiversa+ and maximase the use of the data.

3. **Data Sharing and Collaboration:** Discuss the importance of collaboration among institutions and countries in sharing biodiversity data through GBIF. How can we encourage more participation and data sharing?

Many advantages in sharing data to GBIF. Your work is visible for science and policy. New collaborations. It avoids (in some cases) repetition of collection. BEtter planning of data collection and avoid mistakes that were done in the past. Data what you share are already prepared and standardized.... Collaboration- A node is a good thing. More participation: more visibility to datasets and make them more usable. (small grants for institutions for data mobilization & digitizing)

4. **Technological Advances:** Consider how technological advancements such as machine learning, remote sensing, and DNA sequencing are shaping the future of biodiversity data collection and analysis within GBIF.

We need to make more integration between BOLD and GBIF. Good thing they they are working on that!!

5. **Data Privacy and Security:** Address concerns around data privacy and security within GBIF, particularly regarding sensitive species or locations. How can we balance open access with the need to protect sensitive information?**

  Already addressed today and before. Privacy concers (is GDPR an issue , or maybe not :) ). Name and surname should be provided. Locations for sensitive species can be blurred, **species blurring is not a good thing!!!

6. **Capacity Building:** Explore opportunities for capacity building initiatives to empower researchers, particularly in developing countries, to contribute to and utilize biodiversity data through GBIF.

     Recognize this recognition for GBIF in the citation. Use of bibliographicCitation in DwC should be promoted. In a call, an obligation for sharing data could be mantioned. If you publish in scientific papers before sharing with GBIF, you shoul make sure the connection is made *More Workshops*

9. **Monitoring and Assessment:** Discuss how biodiversity data from GBIF can be used for monitoring changes in biodiversity over time and assessing the effectiveness of conservation efforts.

10. **Future Directions:** Consider the future directions of GBIF and the role it can play in addressing global challenges such as climate change, habitat loss, and species extinction.
